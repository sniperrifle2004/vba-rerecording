VisualBoyAdvance Re-recording
=============================

This is a (hopefully actively maintained, at the very least maintainable)
fork of the google code project at code.google.com/p/vba-rerecording.
Rather than just focus on the re-recording features, the intention is
that this fork will also focus on improving accuracy and maintaining the
multi-platform support.

It currently features a full featured Visual Studio windows build
and more or less working SDL based cli and gtk2+ interfaces.

Right now the focus is at getting the SDL and gtk2 interfaces
up to par and deprecating the old V7 (VisualBoyAdvance 1.7.2) core
code in favor of the V8 (VisualBoyAdvance 1.8.0-some-version) core
code. Contributions of any kind are welcome however.
